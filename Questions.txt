Part 1: Building a RAG system
RAG systems are one of the most widely used patterns which is powering a lot of
AI applications. The basic idea is using an external data source in a vector
database along with an LLM. You have to build a RAG system which works on a
medium sized dataset. In this case you would be working with NCERT PDF text.
○ Build a RAG system and serve it using a FastAPI endpoint. You should be able to
send a query and get a response back.
○ You can use any frontend you see fit to showcase this endpoint.

Part 2
Building an Agent that can perform smart actions based on the
user’s query. Extend the service and host another endpoint for the agent.
○ The agent should be reliably able to decide when to call the VectorDB and when
to not. Ex: Hello -> should not call the VectorDB.
○ Secondly, introduce at least ONE more action / tool in your system that the
Agent can invoke based on the user’s query. Bonus points for more creative
actions!
